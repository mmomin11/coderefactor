In the attached file, you will see a refactored Horiseon site. The functionality is the same as it was pre-refactored. The adjustments were made to the CSS and HTML file to remove and edit any unncessary lines. 

In other words, the coding was left cleaner without affecting the functionality of the website. The current refactored html and CSS files are accesible for any viewer.
